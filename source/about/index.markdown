Being involved in web development since its beginning
with [ObjectCode](http://www.objectcode.de), 
I recently fell in love with lightweight approaches like 
[Lean Startup](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/) and [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/).

I enjoy hacking with [Play! 2.1](http://www.playframework.com) in Java and Scala with Eclipse, 
socializing on [github](https://github.com/joergviola), 
deploying in no time on [heroku](http://heroku.com/), 
blogging on [joergviola.github.com](http://joergviola.github.com).

I also love my family, enjoy running and just started climbing.
Being situated near the Ruhrgebiet, Germany, though, the latter is a bit restricted ;-)
